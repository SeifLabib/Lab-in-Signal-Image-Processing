This repo is based on the course/lab [Lab in Image & Signal Processing](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/lab-in-signal-and-image-processing-EE-490-F), that I have completed.

This repo is based on the lab submissions for the course, mainly based on Jupyter Notebooks.

To be able to use the same packages' versions used here:
- We install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) with the default settings & options.
- We open the Anaconda prompt.
- We create a conda virtual environment to keep dependencies required separate from your different projects.
- We activate the virtual environment.
- We install the required dependencies.
- Edit & Run the Jupyter Notebooks either on the browser or locally.

```
conda create --name IPLAB python=3.8
conda activate IPLAB
pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.17.61 matplotlib jupyter
```
